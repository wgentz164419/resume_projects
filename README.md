# resume_projects (Walker Gentz)
Hello Reader! In this Git Repository are some samples of coding projects from my studies in Python/Java while attending college as well as code for 
sports data analysis in R. Each file in the repository will have details on what is needed to run them and a short description of what the code will do. 
Please reach out if you have any questions about any of the projects/files and I would be glad to answer them. Thank you for your time and consideration!
