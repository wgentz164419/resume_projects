# resume_projects (Walker Gentz)
Hello Reader! In this Git Repository are some samples of coding projects from my studies in Python/Java while attending college as well as code for 
sports data analysis in R. Each file in the repository will have details on what is needed to run them and a short description of what the code will do. 
Please reach out if you have any questions about any of the projects/files and I would be glad to answer them. Thank you for your time and consideration!

 3. Will flip a coin n amount of times and count heads/tails results as well as the ratio
 4. Will flip a coin n amount of times, finding the longest streak of heads and tails as well as printing out flip results if n < 30
 5. Will run n number of expierments, flipping a coin 20 times and counting how many times a streak of 4 heads occurs and printing out the percentage of times it happened

#### Built With
* Python 3.7
