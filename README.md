# resume_projects (Walker Gentz)
Hello Reader! In this Git Repository are some samples of coding projects from my studies in Python/Java while attending college as well as code for 
sports data analysis in R. Each file in the repository will have details on what is needed to run them and a short description of what the code will do. 
Please reach out if you have any questions about any of the projects/files and I would be glad to answer them. Thank you for your time and consideration!

#### Results
The program will ask to enter a menu selection which result in the following:
 1. Will flip a coin one time and print result
 2. Will flip a coin n amount of times and print out results
 3. Will flip a coin n amount of times and count heads/tails results as well as the ratio
 4. Will flip a coin n amount of times, finding the longest streak of heads and tails as well as printing out flip results if n < 30
 5. Will run n number of expierments, flipping a coin 20 times and counting how many times a streak of 4 heads occurs and printing out the percentage of times it happened

#### Built With
* Python 3.7

## Trackr Python Application
#### Needs
You will need the following installed on your machine:
 * Python 3.7

 2. Open project in your IDE
 3. Run the file in your IDE, and the Trackr GUI should open

#### Results
After running the file in your IDE, the Trackr GUI should appear. This GUI will allow you to enter information related to the game and pitch-by-pitch data. 
To use, right click on the zone to show pitch location and then enter pitch data into each input, and finally store pitch data. At the end of the game, close the GUI and a CSV file will be located in the file's folder with the date and the pitch information.
